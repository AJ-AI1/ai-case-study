## Overview and Origin

** Name of company : Microsoft Corporation, Inc "Microsoft"

** Founders, incorporation, and how the idea came about
  
Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico and restructured on June 25, 1981, to become an incorporated business in its home state of Washington (with a further change of its name to "Microsoft Corporation, Inc."). In 1975 Bill Gates and Paul G. Allen, converted BASIC, a popular mainframe computer programming language, for use on an early personal computer (PC), the Altair. Shortly afterward, Gates and Allen founded Microsoft, deriving the name from the words microcomputer and software. During the next few years, they refined BASIC and developed other programming languages.

The world runs on DOS. In 1980, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) asked Microsoft to produce the essential software, or operating system, for its first personal computer, the IBM PC. Microsoft purchased an operating system from another company, modified it, and renamed it MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System). MS-DOS was released with the IBM PC in 1981. Thereafter, most manufacturers of personal computers licensed MS-DOS as their operating system, generating vast revenues for Microsoft; by the early 1990s, it had sold more than 100 million copies of the program and defeated rival operating systems such as CP/M, which it displaced in the early 1980s, and later IBM OS/2. The Windows revolution. Microsoft deepened its position in operating systems with Windows, a graphical user interface whose third version, released in 1990, gained a wide following. By 1993, Windows 3.0 and its subsequent versions were selling at a rate of one million copies per month, and nearly 90 percent of the world’s PCs ran on a Microsoft operating system. In 1995 the company released Windows 95, which for the first time fully integrated MS-DOS with Windows and effectively matched in ease of use Apple Computer’s Mac OS. Powering the office, Microsoft also became the leader in productivity software such as word processing and spreadsheet programs, outdistancing longtime rivals Lotus and WordPerfect in the process.

Entering the media world, Microsoft dramatically expanded its electronic publishing division, created in 1985 and already notable for the success of its multimedia encyclopedia, Encarta. It also entered the information services and entertainment industries with a wide range of products and services, most notably the Microsoft Network and MSNBC (a joint venture with the National Broadcasting Company, a major American television network, which began in 1995 and ended in 2012).

In the early 2000s, Microsoft began experimenting with virtual assistants, starting with the development of a personal assistant for Windows Mobile called Clippy. Although Clippy was not well received by users, it paved the way for the development of more sophisticated virtual assistants, such as Cortana. Cortana was introduced in 2014 as a virtual assistant for Windows 10, and quickly gained popularity due to its ability to understand natural language and perform a wide range of tasks, such as setting reminders and answering questions.

In recent years, Microsoft has continued to invest heavily in AI and virtual assistants, with the launch of its AI platform, Azure Cognitive Services, in 2016, which allows developers to easily integrate AI capabilities into their applications. Additionally, Microsoft has been working on AI-based chatbots and virtual assistants for enterprise use cases, such as customer service and support, and also working on developing AI-based products such as Dynamics 365, Power platform and LinkedIn.
Today, Microsoft is considered one of the leaders in the field of AI and virtual assistants, and the company continues to push the boundaries of what is possible with this technology. With its deep expertise in AI research and development, Microsoft is well positioned to shape the future of AI and virtual assistants for years to come.

Its current best-selling products are the Microsoft Windows operating system; Microsoft Office, a suite of productivity software; Xbox, a line of entertainment of games, music, and video; Bing, a line of search engines; and Microsoft Azure, and a cloud services platform.

** Funding
It was privately funded when it was incorporated, but in fiscal year 2023,it has a record of $211 billion in revenue and over $88 billion in operating income.

## Business Activities

** Specific problem Microsoft is trying to solve
•	Generative AI risks are manyfold, with the technology carrying the potential to produce unwanted outputs or act in a way that could put customers or their data at risk, damage business reputations, or even empower hackers. Many governments are also working on legislation to address and regulate AI use, and the technology will become the focus of intense legal proceedings for years to come. In the face of this, all major AI vendors and developers bear a heavy responsibility. Microsoft has had responsible AI practices in place since 2017, and it has worked to give customers control over their own responsibilities through the Azure Responsible AI dashboard for machine learning (ML) workflows. A vague reference to the “guardrails” Microsoft is working to put in place to protect users from potential infringements on their human rights or legal status may not have been enough to reassure more cynical readers. Microsoft maintains a close relationship with governments, civil society, and experts in the industry to collaborate on AI safety.
•	Mistake-correction AI : Microsoft unveils ‘LeMa’: A revolutionary AI learning method mirroring human problem solving Microsoft have developed a new technique to improve large language models’ (LLMs) ability to solve math problems by having them learn from their mistakes, akin to how humans learn. This has revealed a pioneering strategy, Learning from Mistakes (LeMa), which trains AI to correct its own mistakes, leading to enhanced reasoning abilities. The inspiration was drawn from human learning processes, where a student learns from their mistakes to improve future performance. “Consider a human student who failed to solve a math problem, he will learn from what mistake he has made and how to correct it,”. This concept was applied to LLMs, using mistake-correction data pairs generated by GPT-4 to fine-tune them.
•	It has been acknowledged that AI could take away certain jobs and carries the potential to create new jobs, Microsoft has set out a target to certify 10 million people with digital skills by 2025, has launched a Professional Certificate on Generative AI through LinkedIn Learning, and launched the Generative AI Skills Challenge seeks to help nonprofit and academic organizations provide training for the technology. To date, Microsoft appears to have provided a compelling case for the gains that can be achieved using generative AI tools, but it is through these kinds of initiatives that it can convince customers that AI uptake is not only desirable but achievable.
•	Microsoft has focused efforts on expanding the technological access of non-profit organizations through some discounted and donated tech, and more in this space could help to improve the diversity of voices in the AI community. Down the line, Microsoft may have to reckon this stance with its support for OpenAI, which operates a closed-shop AI approach and currently dominates the market. For the kind of growth it has targeted, developers will require a competitive market that nevertheless allows new startups, tomorrow’s OpenAI, Anthropic, or Cohere, to thrive.

** Intended customer and the market size
Microsoft's customers include individual consumers, small- and medium-sized organizations, enterprises, governmental institutions, educational institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Consumers and small and medium-sized organizations obtain our products primarily through distributors, resellers, and OEMs. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2013, 2012, or 2011 revenue. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant, holding about 21% of the market share in the tech market across various regions around the world.

** Solution major competitors cannot offer
The network effect, economies of scale, and strong branding all of Microsoft has given advantages over their competitors. These competitive advantages illustrate how Microsoft operates globally with popular product suites such as Windows, Office, and Azure but it operates in highly competitive markets that are changing at accelerating rates.
